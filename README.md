# OpenMRSProject

OpenMRS is an open-source electronic health record system. It is used to manage, store, and share patient data for healthcare institutions. OpenMRS is designed particularly to improve healthcare services in low-income countries. This platform supports important functions such as digitizing medical records, patient tracking, treatment planning, and health data analysis.

The OpenMRS Project is open-source and developed by a community. Software developers, healthcare professionals, and volunteers come together in the project to improve data management in healthcare services. OpenMRS provides a user-friendly interface and is adaptable for different healthcare institutions.

The environment we will use is https://openmrs.org. We will be working within the subdomain of this environment, which is https://demo.openmrs.org/.
